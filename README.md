# Instagram User Analytics using SQL

## Problem Overview
In the ever-evolving digital landscape, understanding user behavior on social media platforms is critical for optimizing content strategies and maximizing engagement. The **Instagram User Analytics** project focuses on analyzing user interactions, engagement metrics, and follower growth to uncover insights that drive effective content creation. By identifying these patterns, we can determine what resonates most with users, pinpoint high-engagement content, and even forecast potential trends.

## Dataset Overview
The core of this project is built on the **IG_analytics_dataset**, which contains valuable metrics sourced from public Instagram profiles. Key metrics include:

- **Followers**: The number of followers for each profile.
- **Following**: The number of accounts the user follows.
- **Posts**: Total number of posts created by the user.
- **Likes**: Total likes received across all posts.
- **Comments**: Total comments received across all posts.
- **Engagement Rate**: Computed as the sum of likes and comments divided by the total number of followers.
- **Post Frequency**: Average number of posts published per week.
- **Days Active**: The number of days the user has been active on Instagram.

## Background
Instagram is one of the dominant social media platforms today, used by influencers, businesses, and content creators to engage with audiences and drive brand value. As these users seek to increase their presence and engagement, the need for data-driven insights grows. This project aims to meet that need by analyzing key engagement metrics like post frequency and follower growth, providing actionable insights for users and strategists alike.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition and Preparation**: Collect and clean the **IG_analytics_dataset**, ensuring data consistency and handling any missing information.

3. **Engagement Insights**: Analyze factors affecting engagement, including post frequency, post timing, and content type, to determine what drives user interaction.

4. **Identifying High-Performing Content**: Pinpoint the top-performing posts by examining the number of likes and comments, to reveal what resonates with audiences.

5. **Follower Growth Analysis**: Investigate the factors influencing follower growth over time, exploring trends and potential strategies for increasing followers.

6. **Predictive Modeling**: Implement predictive models to forecast future engagement and follower trends using historical data.


## Conclusion
